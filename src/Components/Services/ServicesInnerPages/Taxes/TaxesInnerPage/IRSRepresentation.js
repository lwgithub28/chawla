                        Receiving an IRS audit letter is often unsettling. Audits require significant time and effort, as they involve gathering substantial records to substantiate every item reported on your tax return. Additionally, you may need to review tax laws to avoid penalties.

                        In our experience, nearly 75% of cases involve the IRS sending a letter or notice requesting clarification or additional information. While some audits are random, there are often specific reasons behind them, such as:

                    IRS auditors are trained to extract more information than you are legally required to provide. They are also aware of the apprehension many people feel about IRS audits. If you are not cautious, IRS auditors may use your fear and inexperience to their advantage.
